**Squad Games is a radical new way to build video games with mods in mind, to the mutual benefit of game devs, mod-makers, and players.**

From MOBAs to Minecraft, video game mods have played a huge role in
building todayâ€™s gaming industry. But mod ecosystems are difficult to
build, and most game developers decide not to include mod systems.

With Squad Games, anyone can submit new mods to your game,
those mods are well curated, and the value created brings in new
players. Revenues are shared between mod-makers and game developers.
