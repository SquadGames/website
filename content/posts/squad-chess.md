### Try the [Squad Chess Demo](https://chess.squad.games)

Squad Chess is the first game built using the Squad Games Platform,
meant as a demonstration.

Itâ€™s a moddable version of chess that lets users create new chess
pieces and formats from inside the game, e.g. a king that moves like a
pawn but takes like a knight. Make any board size and shape
with any starting pieces and position, then submit your new format for
others to buy and play.
