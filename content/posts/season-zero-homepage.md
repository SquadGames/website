When videogames are owned by their communities, everything changes. We are bringing decentralization and the ownership economy to videogame development so this powerful new engine can drive the troubled industry to a more equitable and valuable future. Ownership will be held by communities and individuals who build value rather than large companies who build sandcastle moats of unreasonable license agreements.

Squad Games is a fundamentally new way to organize videogame development with trustless licence agreements between developers, players, and modders---who are often the biggest innovators.
* Better games for more diverse audiences
* Fair compensation and ownership for communities and innovators
* Relief from the content treadmill
* Relief from the impossibilities of balancing a game

Come sample the future of game dev with our demo game [Squad Chess](https://chess.squad.games). We are hard at work on a Season Zero friendly competition, and we invite you to participate. Sign up for our [newsletter](https://squadgames.substack.com) and join our [discord](https://discord.gg/BuCMZ59) so you don’t miss it.

We’re delighted to be partnering with Web3API on their launch. Their tools will dramatically simplify the work of building Squad Games, and dramatically simplify the work of building games on Squad Games.
